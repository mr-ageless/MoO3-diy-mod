Moo3DLL.dll
___________

The Moo3DLL.dll file needs to be placed in the same directory as your Moo3.exe file.
By default, this will be "C:\Program Files\Infogrames\Master of Orion 3\"
If it is not located there, and you are unable to find it manually, use the windows
file search program, and look for "Moo3.exe".

Once you have moved the Moo3DLL.dll file, you need to apply support for it via the
patcher.  This will install the code to use the dll file in the executable, and allow
you to apply dll patches.
