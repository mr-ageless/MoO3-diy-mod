/***Otsego's Diplomatic Mod V2.0***/
/***10/02/03***/



/***Explanation***/

Changes since 1.0:

-Enabled more of the original, unused phrases.
-Fixed a typo that disabled almost half of the reply intro phrases
-Altered an unused function so that it now generates adjectives based 
 on the emphasis style
-Rewrote and moved existing text to different categories to make 
 better sense
-Fixed a lot of typos
-Doubled the amount of proposal phrases used*
-Wrote many new phrases
-Shorter phrases now occur less frequently
-Added a few religious phrases for use with Richy's Ethos Mod

* I managed to do this by exploiting a bug in one of the functions 
originally used for speeches, so now each proposal type has 2 
distinct phrases that it can use to generate a message instead of one,
and the exchange proposal can now choose from 12(!)

If you want to contact me for any reason, the best way to do it would 
be on the Official MOO3 forums. My retarded screen name is Otsego19.


/***Installation***/

To install, just extract the zip file into your Moo3 folder.

If you had installed V1.0, delete the misnamed "Speadsheets" folder.

/***Uninstallation***/

To uninstall this mod, delete the DiploExcuses.txt, 
DiploFormatLists.txt, DiploLeadIns.txt, DiploOffers.txt, 
DiploPEmphasisLists.txt, DiploTables.txt, and DiploREmphasisLists.txt from the Spreadsheets 
folder, and the wsDiploMatic.txt from the wStrings folder.

If you want to delete all of the extra phrases but keep the corrected 
punctuation, delete everything but DiploFormatLists.txt.
