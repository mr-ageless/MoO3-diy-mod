A sample (although complete) RaceAlias.ini file is included with this release.
As you should see, the format for setting an alias is:
"RACEX00Y<tab>Alias", where X = species number, Y = race number, and 0 is zero,
not capital o.  These can be obtained from racemodifiers.txt (make sure you use 
"species number", not "UI species number").  Do not use RacePickPoints, as the 
table is incorrect by default.

The RACEX00Y value is hardcoded, and can be used with the RaceAlias.ini file.  To
add it to TechTables.txt, move to the Sort_Tags column, and add it using the same
system already present (delimited by commas).  You can add multiple RACEX00Y tags
to the same tech (or multiple aliases).

Currently, the NO will not get any race-specific technology.  This is hardcoded.  If
you want a race to be guarunteed to get a tech, you must included "KEEPTHIS" to the
Sort_Tags column as well as the racial tag.  Without this, the tech is checked against
TechKnow to see if the race has it in their tree.

Untested but assumed:  Other races can steal, trade or conquer racial tech.  They
simply cannot research it.
