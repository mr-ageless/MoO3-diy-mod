===================================================
A PDF version of the manual can be found on the CD 1 in the Extras Folder and is in a printable .PDF format.  A copy of Acrobat Reader is also enclosed.

===================================================
10: MANUAL ERRATA
===================================================
In this section, you'll find descriptions of the enhancements and design improvements that have been made to the game since the manual was sent off to be printed. There are new information displays on some of the screens, and a number of modifications to the keyboard commands. In addition, we've provided greater detail on a number of features which were covered only briefly in the manual.

DRAGGING & DROPPING IN TASK FORCE/GROUND FORCE CREATION
Dragging and dropping between the Reserves Panel and the Assembly Queue is no longer supported. You can still Drag and Drop within the Assembly Queue (moving ships from pickets to escorts, for example).

THE ORION GUARDIANS
Sometimes, you will come across a ruined planet which was once the home world for an ancient Antaran race. This home world may contain various specials, including one of the five Antaran Xs.

Unfortunately, this world will also be protected by an Orion Guardian, one of the tremendously powerful technologies developed by the Antarans. This Guardian is programmed to attack and destroy any visitors to the system. It can be defeated, but doing so requires a very large fleet possessing significant technology beyond that with which you begin the game.

If you encounter a Guardian and do not want to fight, select the Blockade Planet option in the Combat Scheduler Screen. Combat will begin, but you can then immediately Retreat before the Guardian begins shooting. When you return to the Galaxy Map, you will be forced to leave the system and retreat to a friendly star.

Stars that contain Guardians are not labeled as such on the Galaxy Map. There are up to five in any given galaxy.

GALAXY MAP SCREEN
Fleet Information Popup: This panel appears when you click on any Fleet that you control. It shows a summary of the ships in each Task Force. At the bottom of the panel, the Disband Selected Task Force button allows you to remove the Task Force from the map and return all of its ships to the Reserves. They will be available again in a few turns for redeployment. The Clear AI Orders button is useful if you decide to take control of a fleet that was built in response to a Colonize command that you previously issued. Clicking this button removes the selected Task Force from AI control and removes its orders to move to a designated location. It is now fully under your control, and the icon will therefore move to the right of the star it's currently orbiting, if any.

The Galaxy Map shows you all the stars that you can explore in the Orion Sector. Stars with names in your empire's color indicate that you have a Colony there. If the name is in lower case, you have only an Outpost (less than one population point, which means you have less than 1,000 people there). If the name is in parentheses, it means more than one race has an Outpost or Colony there.

The following controls are changed (see the Shortcuts section at the end for a list of new commands):

[Enter] – Will now normalize rotation, zoom, and scroll on the Galaxy Map 
[Shift-Enter] – Will now Process a Turn

Mouse right-click functions are not all implemented as described. Use Right-click to pan the map, and use the keyboard controls to rotate and pan.

SYSTEM SURVEY SCREEN
On the Planet Overview Panel, the Gravity value is now colored to indicate its desirability for your race, as follows:

GREEN: Ideal
YELLOW: One or two levels away from ideal
RED: Three or more levels away from ideal

PLANET SCREEN
[Shift-Right-Click] is now used to remove items from a build queue on the Economics Panel. You can also double-click on items, as before.

In addition to the minus [-] key, you can also use the [ESCAPE] key to return to the previous screen (Galaxy Map, SitRep, or Planets Screen).

The comma [,] and period [.] keys will take you to the next and the previous planet that you own. If you got to the Planet Screen from the Planets Screen, then these keys will show you only the planets selected on that screen. Thus, if you set the Filters on the Planets Screen to show only Close Environment planets that you own, you'll only see the Green worlds when you use these keys.

There are now three new items listed with the icons on the right-hand side of the screen. These are:

DEA Employment: these two numbers show the number of population points currently employed on the planet, and the number of jobs available. Ideally, of course, these numbers will be equal. If DEAs are less than fully staffed, production will be proportionally reduced at all DEAs on the planet.

DEA Productivity from Population: This percentage represents how effectively the planet is using the population in DEAs. If the number is less than 100%, it means that there are too few population points on this planet to work all of the possible jobs. It can also get much greater than 100%. This means that you're getting the benefit of technological boosts to productivity which makes each individual count as more than one.

If you have extra population, they're essentially placed into "supporting" roles within your industrial base, though there's a diminishing return as the excess increases. They will increase your DEA Productivity, but less so as the total number of extra people increases.

Unrest: the Unrest is now displayed in this section for easier readability. The values are the same as before.

SPACE COMBAT SCREEN
In Space Combat, you now see numbers which show how many points of damage were done to the target. These are only shown if the attack succeeded in hitting the target. The color depends on what was damaged:

BLUE: Shield hit. No damage to the ship itself
YELLOW: Armor hit. Some armor was destroyed
RED: Hull damage

Maneuver and concentration of force are important in space combat. If you are not being targeted by anybody in the battle, you will get damage and accuracy bonuses to all of your direct-fire weapons because you have the time to aim carefully. If you are being targeted by two or more groups, your accuracy goes down.

From a practical standpoint, this means that you'll have a significant advantage in combat if you can use two Task Forces to gang up on a single opposing force. For example, Long Range Space Superiority Task Forces can reduce the effectiveness of enemy fleets in a given battle by keeping them engaged while your Short Range ships close in, giving them a slight advantage during the risky approach when they're still too far away to engage.

In order to do combat against a planet, it must at least have a Colony. You cannot engage in Space Combat against a planet which only has an Outpost.

Note: right-clicking the mouse in Space Combat does not rotate, tilt or pan the view. For a complete list of Space Combat mouse and keyboard commands, see the Shortcuts section at the top of this file.

PERSONNEL SCREEN, ESPIONAGE PANEL
Note that you can only build a single spy at a given time.

FINANCE SCREEN
The manual refers to a "Confirm" button. The actual text for the button now says "Close." Functionally, there is no difference.

TECHNOLOGY SCREEN
Using the Research sliders: The sliders for the six Schools work a little differently when you click and drag the control versus when you use the left/right arrows. If you use the arrows, the budget for the current item will be increased by 1%, and the budget for the next School with funds allocated will be reduces by that same amount. This will repeat until that School's funding is exhausted, at which point funds will be taken from the next School in sequence. If you use the slider, however, you're able to change the setting by much more than 1% in a single action. In that case, the code will attempt to balance the effect of the change across all currently budgeted schools, so you'll probably see all five other sliders move if you make a significant alteration.

You can use the Lock buttons to the right of each School slider to prevent that slider from moving while you adjust another.

RESTARTING FROM A SAVED GAME
If you experience a problem with the game in either solitaire or multiplayer play, you should first try to exit the game and restart from the most recent saved game. This will very often resolve the problem, allowing you to take a slightly difference course in order to avoid the problem the next time.

This process works for both solitaire and multiplayer games.

===================================================
11: GAMEPLAY EXPLANATIONS/CLARIFICATIONS
===================================================

SOLE SUPERPOWER OPTION
There is no longer a check-box next to the Sole Superpower victory condition on the Game Setup screen. This is because eliminating all of your opponents in the Galaxy is always a victory condition (in effect, you've made yourself the de-facto President of the Senate).

TASK FORCE COMPOSITION
The manual lists the old numbers of ships for the different task force sizes (up to 64 for Armada- page 126). This is incorrect; the current task force sizes are:

Detachment: 1 ship
Squadron: 2-4 ships
Flotilla: 5-7 ships
Wave: 8-10 ships
Pack: 11-14 ships
Armada: 15-18 ships

COLINIZATION/OUTPOST EXPLORATION
The AI will always colonize with ships that are in your reserves; they will *not* colonize if you already have a Colony Task Force on the Galaxy Map. This is intentional behavior, giving you total control over where you want your deployed Task Forces to go on the Galaxy Map. Additionally, you must wait one turn before being able to build anything on a newly colonized planet. The same goes for Outpost Ships.

When you colonize a RED planet, you only get 1/4 of a population point (250 pop) per colony pod landed there. So, if you want to build a colony there you will need to land 4 ships (or 1 ship with 4 pods), set migration, or just wait for the population to increase to a full point naturally. YELLOW planets get 1/2 population point (500 population) per colony pod.

INBOUND ANTARAN EXPEDITION LOST
If you have discovered an X off-map and have an In-Bound Task Force, there’s a rare chance that you may have your X hijacked by an enemy empire. If this is the case, turn your efforts to spying immediately to try and recover it. Remember, Xs are most vulnerable when they are being researched; and be sure to use Scientific Spies!

BUILDING SPIES
For balance reasons, Spies can only be built one at a time. You will, however, be able to build better spies through technology discoveries.

PLANETARY BOMBARDMENT
Colonies do not become “Active” until they hit 1,000 Population (see below). When bombarding a planet, the population may dip below the 1K mark; if that is the case, your Bombardment Weapons will have no further effect unless you have Planet Destroying capabilities. You will either need to invade and take it over or wait until you have those capabilities. This is intentional, as some population will remain scattered, living underground or in caves. Also, population on a bombarded planet will continue to grow from turn to turn, albeit at a very stunted rate. See the Destroying Planets section below.

MILITIA
Militia are created out of population to defend planets. Even if you have no garrisoned troops, Militia will rise up to defend. The amount of Militia depends on the number of settled regions and size of the planet. Militia generally aren’t very good, but they may be able to hold off an assault for a few turns while you bring in the reinforcements.

RETREATING IN SPACE COMBAT
Because of the Warp capabilities, Starships can Retreat at any time during a Space Combat. *System Ships*, however, fight to the death and will never retreat; they are considered the last line of defense and will stand or fall with the planet in question. This is balanced out by their superior speed, their ability to carry more firepower/tech/armor and their generally lower cost.

PIRACY
Each inhabited region in your system generates one point of piracy.

For each hull size of combat ships in the system, piracy is reduced by one (so the smallest ship, a Hawk, will eliminate piracy in a newly colonized system). Orbitals and System Ships also contribute to piracy reduction in the same manner.

Planetary Shields reduce piracy by 1/10 of their Strength, so once you get this technology it's a good idea to build them soon. They'll pretty much eliminate piracy in your systems.

THE OPPRESSOMETER
Note that the Oppressometer setting will affect your Heavy Foot of Government. The higher you set it, the greater the chance on any given turn of there being an increase in the HFOG level for your empire. The chance of an increase is a number of percent equal to the Oppressometer setting (which ranges from 1 to 10). A mid-range setting will result in a 5% chance of increase each turn. 

HOW DEAS WORK
DEAs, or Dominant Economic Activities, let you determine the economic zoning of the planet. Each region of the planet can support 2 DEAs and one spaceport DEA. Your planetary viceroy will automatically create new DEAs, as needed, based on the development policies that you have established. But you can also set up your own, if you want. 

Terrain affects the efficiency of some DEAs. Mining is best in Mountainous regions, and Bioharvesting (Farming) works best in Plains. Note that this is reversed for the Silicoids, whose Bioharvesting works best in Mountains and Mining in Plains. And terrain has no effect for the Cybernetics. 

Mineral Richness also affects Mining efficiency. Fertility affects Bioharvesting efficiency. 

In addition, some races and species have modifiers which affect efficiency, and there are various buildings and Achievements which affect it. 

All DEAs start with a Capacity of 1. This will increase as your planetary viceroy builds new capacity-enhancing buildings in that DEA. Think of capacity as representing the size of the facilities: warehouses, factories, and so on. 

DEAs require population to run. The amount depends on the type of DEA and the number of capacity-enhancing buildings it contains. Efficiency-enhancing buildings do not require population -- they just make the existing facilities more productive. 

If you don't have enough population on a planet to completely fill all DEA requirements, then all DEAs will produce proportionally less in direct relation to the percentage shortfall. If you have half the number of population points you need to run the planet, each DEA on that planet will be producing at half its normal output. 

You can see if you have enough population on a planet by going to the Planet Screen and looking at the DEA Productivity from Population number. If it's less than 100%, you don't have enough population. If it's more than 100%, either you have extra population or you're getting benefits from efficiency-enhancing technologies. 

If you have extra population, they're essentially placed into "supporting" roles within your industrial base, though there's a diminishing return as the excess increases. You can only have so many personal attendants, after all.

A NOTE ABOUT FLUS
Robots do not necessarily go onto the planet that built them. They belong to the empire as a whole, and are therefore more like ships than like DEAs.

When you build a robot, it goes to the empire to distribute. To find them on a planet, look in the Demographics tab. They show up as a count of robotic workers. Also, the robots wear out after a while. Therefore, that count can and will go down over time. 
This is true of all types except Economic FLUs, which stay in the empire and generate money. The amount of money can be found in the Empire's Finance->Ledger panel.

MAKING GRANTS TO PLANETS
The Budget Panel of the Finance Screen allows you to give grants to planets from the Empire level. These are very useful in building up the infrastructure of your growing civilization. Here's how they work:

There is a slider on this screen labeled Grants to Planets. Funds provided here are distributed to planets which request them for various purposes. Poor planets (those with little in the bank and little income) will ask for grants. Those which are spending too much because of player actions will also ask for grants (i.e. the player has increased the Terraforming slider on a given planet, and that planet does not have sufficient funds to spend the desired amount).

The Empire will rank the requests based on the Univalue of each planet, and will then select the ten planets with the lowest Univalues to receive the allocated funds. These will be placed into the planetary bank, and will be available for use on the following turn.

The Univalue (represented by a circle around the planet) shows the relative development of that planet by the civilization that controls it, based on that civilization's maximum technological abilities in the areas of economic development, environmental development, population size, and military defense.

Note: not all grant monies will reach individual planets. The government bureaucracy takes a little off the top, so don't be surprised if not all of your 100 AU grant gets distributed to the planets. If you notice that significant amounts of money are being lost in this way, it may be more effective for you to lower empire-wide taxes and raise taxes on planets to compensate. Money is always transferred in a more efficient manner when it stays local.

DIPLOMACY: PAYING TRIBUTE
When a Pay Tribute is exchanged via Diplomacy, the trade value is perceived to be 1% of the GDP of the paying Civilization. The amount per turn traded is 1/18 of that, or about .06%. The amount is fixed for the duration of the tribute.
 
For Unconditional Surrender, the payment is a (fixed) random 3-8% of current income for the length of the enforced peace. For Conditional Surrender, the payment is a (fixed) random 1-3.5% of current income for the length of the enforced peace. Armistice and Peace Accord have no payment.

GOVERNMENT SERIES
Government types are now divided into three major Series: Absolutist, Representative, and Collectivist. Not all government types are available to you at the start of the game. You will begin with a government type that is typical of your species, and may be able to improve it through research and through carefully planned changes in government type during the game.

The types are listed here in approximate order of increasing sophistication:

ABSOLUTIST SERIES 
  Despotism 
  Monarchy 
  Oligarchy 
  Constitutional Monarchy 

REPRESENTATIVE SERIES 
  Corporate 
  Democracy 
  Parliamentary 
  Republicanism 

COLLECTIVIST SERIES 
  Hive 
  Unification

DESIGNING AND BUILDING SHIPS

Creating larger ships requires that you have certain buildings on the planet that will be making the ships. For each of the buildings listed below, you will increase the maximum available hull size by one. If you have all of these buildings, you will therefore be able to build ships of the largest possible size:

  Basic Systems Module
  Space Environment Module
  Matter Conversion Module
  Materials Processor
  Automated Assembly Module
  Project Management Systems
  Societal Workplace Module
  Orbital Access Module
  Space Dock Extension
  Military Design Center

Remember, you can design a ship but not have the capabilities to build it. The PLANETS tab will tell you, at a glance, the shipyard capability of a particular planet.

INTEREST ON SAVINGS
There is no longer any interest paid on the balance of funds in the player's bank at the end of a turn. Interest must still be paid on any outstanding debt balance, however.

CONTROLLING UNREST
To lower unrest, experiment with these techniques (note that each planet and each race will differ in their needs, so you'll have to adapt the approach to your unique situation): 

1. Lower the tax rate, either across the galaxy or on this planet. 

2. Build more Government DEAs on this planet (the people will be somewhat less rebellious if you're providing more services locally). 

3. Reduce your industrial output and research if they're being overdriven (working your people too hard will make them restless). 

4. Put more military forces on the planet (people will behave better when they know there's a price for disobedience). 

5. Build some Recreation DEAs on the planet. 

6. Improve your policy toward Forced Labor units, or eliminate them entirely. 

7. Lower the setting on your Oppressometer. This will increase the odds of trouble from enemy spies, but will make your people happier. 

8. Allocate money toward Unrest Reduction at the Empire level. 

9. Wait. Some things, such as changes in government type, will cause short-term unrest that lasts five to ten turns. As people grow accustomed to the new status quo, their level of discomfort will drop significantly.

CONTROLLING SPYING
Other empires know that one good way to knock down their opponents is to send Spies. The Orions are especially prone to doing this.

You can defend yourself from Spies in a number of ways:

1. Increase the setting on the Oppressometer. This has a direct effect on the likelihood of enemy spies getting into your empire and of getting caught. And catching spies helps you determine who's sending them, if you can make them talk. However, increasing this setting will increase Unrest in your empire, and also increases the chance of a rise in your Heavy Foot of Government.

2. Recruit Spies and leave them unassigned (via the Espionage Panel on the Personnel Screen). Unassigned Spies are placed on anti-espionage duties within your empire.

3. Threaten the empire which is sending Spies to you. They may back off militarily or reduce spying. There's no guarantee of what they'll do, but it will probably improve matters for you in some way.

4. Establish solid treaties and alliances with other empires. The more they like you (positive Casus Belli and/or Current Relations, as shown on the Victory Screen), the less they'll be interested in spying on you.

Note that your enemies understand the value of disrupting your economy, and are smart enough to send Spies when at war with you, knowing that they may get lucky and do some serious damage. Be wary.

MAINTENANCE COSTS
Nothing comes for free. Even after you build a ship or a missile base, there are continuing costs for maintenance. Even in this advanced technological universe, the roof still leaks sometimes, and light bulbs still need replacing from time to time.

Maintenance costs in MOO3 are computed as follows:

Buildings: 5% of initial PP cost, translated into AUs (so if the building cost 100 PPs, maintenance would be 5 AUs per turn).

FLUs: 5% per turn

Spies: 5% per turn

Leaders: 5% per turn

Ships (all types): .5% per turn if activated, .1% if in Reserves

Ground Forces: 
  Armies: .8% per turn, .4% if in Reserves
  Divisions: .3% per turn, .15% if in Reserves
  Corps: .2% per turn, .1% if in Reserves

COLONIZING: THE FIRST TURNS
When a colony ship lands, you'll get a Situation Report (SitRep) message announcing the landing. If there are enough colonists on board to colonize the given world (see below regarding colonization of Red and Yellow planets), you'll see a second SitRep message announcing the successful establishment of the new Colony.

You will not be able to build new structures or being manufacturing items on the turn that the new colony is established, because your economy will not yet be running. That requires one more turn.

If you included armed escort ships in your colonization Task Force, they will be disbanded and returned to the Reserves upon successful colonization of the planet.

Note: it is possible for two allied empires to colonize a single world in the same turn. In this case, the empire which has more settlers on the world on that turn will be deemed the owner of the planet.

COLONIZING YELLOW AND RED PLANETS
It's more difficult to establish a colony on a world whose Habitability is either Yellow or Red. Not all settlers are able to survive the harsh conditions.

When you land a Colony Ship on a Yellow world, the population will be only 50% of the normal value of one population point. On a Red world, it will be only 25%.

Therefore, it may take a little time for such worlds to build up to full Colony status, which requires one full population point. Until then, they will be considered Outposts, and you will not have the normal degree of control over them. You can tell that a planet is an Outpost because its name will be shown in lower case instead of being capitalized.

You can accelerate this process by sending multiple Colony Ships to a single planet. Any which land prior to the turn on which it achieves full Colony status will add their population to the planet. You cannot colonize any planet which already has an established Colony on it. To ensure the immediate creation of a Colony on a Red world, you can send a Task Force with four Colony Ships.

COLONIZING MAGNATE CIVILIZATION PLANETS
You can land a Colony Ship on any planet with a Magnate Civilization. Once you achieve 1.0 or more population points on that world, it will become part of your empire, no different than an unoccupied world except that it already has a significant native population that considers it to be in the Green Habitability Zone.

If you come across a Magnate Civ on a Red 1 or Red 2 planet, it's worth trying to get a colony there. Once you achieve minimum population for your colony (which will take some effort), you'll have 4 or 5 population points of workers who operate at 100% efficiency, unlike your settlers, and who will be happy to begin building DEAs for you.

DESTROYING PLANETS
In order to completely destroy a planet, you will need a Stellar Converter on at least one ship that survives until the Bombardment Phase of Space Combat. In addition, the device must be mounted on a Very Heavy Mount or something heavier in order to be considered a Planet Destroying Weapon (it's possible, though unusual, to build a Point Defense version of a Stellar Converter).

If you have a Planet Destroying Weapon and are bombarding a planet, the Destroy Planet button will be enabled.

===================================================
12: THE MOO3 PREFERENCES FILE
===================================================
Master of Orion 3 uses a separate Preferences file on your hard disk to control some less-used features that are not accessible via the Options screen. It is an ordinary text file, named MOO3Prefs.ini. You can edit it using Notepad, WordPad, or Microsoft Word, but be sure to save it out in Text Only format. This section explains certain options in that file which may be of interest to some players.

MOUSE WHEEL SPEED
The normal setting for the mouse wheel is as follows:

MouseWheelSensitivity=4

You can set this value to any number between 1 and 10. The higher the number, the more the scrolling text region will move for the same amount of movement on the wheel.

DISABLING THE "PUSH SCROLLING" FEATURE
Some players may prefer that the screen not scroll when the mouse is moved to the very edge of the window, as is the default. The default state of this option is:

galaxyPushScrollingDisabled=0

In order to turn the feature off, simply change this to:

galaxyPushScrollingDisabled=1

====================================================
13: MULTIPLAYER
===================================================
DISCONNECT MESSAGE
In multiplayer the host must always be one of the players participating in the game. If the host empire has his last planet destroyed the game will shut down and display the message: "Host Disconnected - The host empire has lost". To continue, one of the other players in the game will need to take over as host and resume the game.
