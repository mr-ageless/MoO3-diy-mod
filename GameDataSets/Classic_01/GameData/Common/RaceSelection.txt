There are three ways that this patch will function.  Mode 1, the default, will try and generate 
the races without making any duplications.  Mode 2 allows you to create a file which will 
determine which races are in the game.  The order is top down, and if there are more than the 
number of AI players you are using, the will be ignored.  The final mode is a combination of 
modes 1 and 2.  An example to illustrate - you are playing with 16 AI players.  You set 8 of the 
players in the config file.  The remaining 8 will be randomly generated, again, avoiding 
duplication if possible.

A sample RaceConfig.ini file is included (with a .sample tag).  If you wish to use this file, 
rename the file to RaceConfig.ini.  As with the RacialTech patch, the RaceAlias.ini file is used
to determine aliases for the various races.  You can use that file (see the description for the
RacialTech patch), or you can use the RACEx00y format, where x is the species, and y is the race
of the race you wish to use.

An example:  Cynoids are species 3, race 1.  So to add them to the config file, you'd create a 
new line with "RACE3001".  For more information on the species/race numbers, consult the 
"racemodifiers.txt" file.  

***PLEASE NOTE*** The racemodifiers.txt file has two columns for species, one labelled "Species" 
and one labelled "UISpecies" in the RaceMod table.  Use the number from the "Species" column.  
Do NOT use the RacePickPoints table, as the numbers in it are incorrect.
