It is known that the structure of sub-space bends and twists based on fluctuations in local gravity fields. Any mass produces some gravity, and therefore any nearby ships creates tiny ripples in subspace that can be recorded by this system. The motion analyzer allows even very stealthy warships to be detected at considerable distances and can identify their vector and approximate size. The overall scanning capacity of the DEA is increased as a result. "		384

The Metahex Wave Scanning facility, which can be constructed in a Military DEA, implements a version of their sensor systems in a ground facility. The scanners divide the space within range into fixed divisions, dubbed 'hexes' (for Hyperspace Echo X-tics, a unit of common measurement instituted by the Antarans). Each hex, in turn, is bombarded with a tachyon wave. The wave will return to the scanner, modified in form by any masses located within the hex. The size, profile, and vector of any ship in range can be identified using this system. While power-intensive, this scanning system provides invaluable data with a precision not otherwise possible. This technology improves the scanning capacity of any Military DEA that employs it. "		385

By standardizing packing structures to use the hexagonal structure (i.e., Honeycomb Warehousing), spaceports become more efficient in both use of storage space and access to goods and materials. Moreover, the strength of the interlocking hexagon structure allows the storage units to be used as part of the building's structural integrity itself, which in turn liberates even more internal space for storage.

TECHNOLOGIES NOT IN USE																						" In an ideal world, when an important position needed to be filled, the best candidate from those available would be chosen. In practice, this is often not the case. Structured Interviewing changes this by ensuring that the right sorts of questions are asked during the candidate selection process and that the answers correspond with carefully crafted data analyzers to indicate various levels of suitability ranked by category. Thus, much of the subjective interview data garnered from a candidate can be used to obtain objective information and best fill job needs accordingly. This ensures that the candidate selected for a promotion is chosen at least partly based on each candidate's ability. "		427
Transdimensional Portal	TATransD	TBTransD	None	" System, Antaran "	TransDim	Achieve	Antar_01	ICO_SitRep_AntaranExpedition	None	TransDim=1												" Structured Interviews help ensure the candidate selection process is well-documented and less subjectively weighed. Meritocratic Incentives takes the process a step farther by re-emphasizing the importance of a candidate's qualifications and track record of on-the-job effectiveness, and putting them on prominent display both in the workplace and on job applications. This makes it is much harder to land a position by knowing the right person or through even more overt means such as bribery or extortion, and rewards those who achieve in the workplace with instant recognition that is of general societal regard. This plays a critical role in selecting candidates for promotion with an eye to each candidate's ability. "		428

They can be wiped or flung onto the target's hull by a nearby vessel or station, or even coated to a hatch so that the ship is 'tagged' when it docks. The beacons periodically burst-transmit their position, a signal that can be received by security forces anywhere in the same star system. Nano Homing Beacons make smuggling much more difficult as they are hard to detect and even harder to remove once they've integrated themselves into the ship's hull. System Security is improved throughout the civilization. "		429
