"For each star lane level, how much does it cost to improve to that level and how much does it cost to degrade to that level.  TravelCost is how much it costs ships to travel across a lane at this level."			
Other information can also be added to this table.

This gives a multiplier (as a fixed point) that should be multiplied times the distance between two stars to determine how long it takes to travel between them.  There is also a 	
"fudge factor multiplier, which allows us to set the ratios between the types of travel, and then tune overall speed using the fudge factor."
