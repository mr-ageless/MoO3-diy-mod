	 Gives the chance of building an orbital or system ship, expressed as an int from 1 to 100.  Chance is base + border + 				
	 threatened + home system. The min systems is a divisor - if we have less than this many systems, we multiply by the  				
	 number of systems we have, then divide by min systems.

	 If we've decided to build a system defense, gives the percent chance to build an planetary defense.  Otherwise, we  				
	 build a system ship.  For each class of planet (only planet, best planet, or other), we have a base chance and then  				
	a multiplier to multiply by the number of system ships.  There is also a cap for each category.  The multiplier is float.

	 The percent chance of deciding to build a deployment center on a system seat that doesn't have one, as an int from 1 			
	 to 100.  (Base + (per jump * jump to closest deployment center)) * border.  If > cap, set to cap.  Border is a float

	This table gives multipliers (as fixed point) to the priority of each of the categories of military build queue items.  It's			
	 intended to facilitate balance, but for significant changes you may want to modify the functions themselves.

	 This table tells us how much we want to outnumber the enemy by on the defense, and also when we attack.  Basically, 										
	 we count hull sizes, multiply by a factor based on effectiveness in past battles, and then multiply by this factor.
