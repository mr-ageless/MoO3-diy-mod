"Row headings are a list of all the modifiers in the game.  UpOrDown is a minus sign to note that for this modifier, a lower value is better than a higher value."										
"A plus sign notes the opposite.  A '!' means this 'modifier' is just information, not a real modification. "										
Scale Factor is a number that gets multiplied with the modifier value to give us a number relative to 100 for the AI to know how much a modifier helps or hurts.										
Base Priority is used by the AI to assign initial priorities to the modifiers										

"The columns for Peace and Prosperity, Peace Through Strength, Limited War, Total War and Holy War are the priorities given to this modifier"										
"when the planet AI is deciding what to build, depending on the political economy setting"
