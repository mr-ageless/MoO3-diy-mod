	NOTE: numbers used in this spreadsheet should match the enumerated types in SCAIEnums.h.		

	Add a row to this spreadsheet for each ship you want to be designed for the player at the beginning of the game.		
	Most of the columns are obvious.  Give a hull size of -1 if you want to have the design AI use the smallest hull it		
	"can.  If you give a design that isn't possible at the beginning of the game, nothing will be produced.  Count is the "		
	number of ships of this design which should be given to each human player at the start of the game.  The AIs will 		
	get the same starting ships.  The row header will be the ship type name for the human player.  Hull sizes go from		
	0..13 here.
