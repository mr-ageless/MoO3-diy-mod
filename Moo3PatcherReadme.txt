Moo3 Patcher
____________

This program allows pre-made 'patches' to be applied or removed from the Moo3.exe file.  It works in concert with the PatchPak (and, in fact, is functionless without .patch files).

Although every effort has been made to ensure patches are harmless, the potential exists that they can cause damage to your installation of Moo3.  Therefore, making a backup of your Moo3.exe file is highly recommended.

Comments, concerns, questions can be addressed to bhruic@gmail.com or on the AtariMOO forum (the forum is prefered as it will enable others to either help you, or learn from the answers - check the "Fan Modifications" Moo3 forum.
